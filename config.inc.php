 * Timezone

// The timezone your meeting rooms run in. It is especially important
// to set this if you're using PHP 5 on Linux. In this configuration
// if you don't, meetings in a different DST than you are currently
// in are offset by the DST offset incorrectly.
//
// Note that timezones can be set on a per-area basis, so strictly speaking this
// setting should be in areadefaults.inc.php, but as it is so important to set
// the right timezone it is included here.
//
// When upgrading an existing installation, this should be set to the
// timezone the web server runs in.  See the INSTALL document for more information.

// A list of valid timezones can be found at http://php.net/manual/timezones.php

/*******************
 * Themes
 *******************/

// Choose a theme for the MRBS.   The theme controls two aspects of the look and feel:
//   (a) the styling:  the most commonly changed colours, dimensions and fonts have been 
//       extracted from the main CSS file and put into the styling.inc file in the appropriate
//       directory in the Themes directory.   If you want to change the colour scheme, you should
//       be able to do it by changing the values in the theme file.    More advanced styling changes
//       can be made by changing the rules in the CSS file.
//   (b) the header:  the header.inc file which contains the function used for producing the header.
//       This enables organisations to plug in their own header functions quite easily, in cases where
//       the desired corporate look and feel cannot be changed using the CSS alone and the mark-up
//       itself needs to be changed.
//
//  MRBS will look for the files "styling.inc" and "header.inc" in the directory Themes/$theme and
//  if it can't find them will use the files in Themes/default.    A theme directory can contain
//  a replacement styling.inc file or a replacement header.inc file or both.

// Available options are:

// "default"        Default MRBS theme
// "classic126"     Same colour scheme as MRBS 1.2.6

$theme = "default";

// Use the $custom_css_url to override the standard MRBS CSS.
//$custom_css_url = 'css/custom.css';

// TIMES SETTINGS
// --------------

// These settings are all set per area through MRBS.   These are the default
// settings that are used when a new area is created.

// The "Times" settings are ignored if $enable_periods is TRUE.

// Note: Be careful to avoid specifying options that display blocks overlapping
// the next day, since it is not properly handled.

// Resolution - what blocks can be booked, in seconds.
// Default is half an hour: 1800 seconds.
$resolution = (30 * 60);  // DEFAULT VALUE FOR NEW AREAS

// The default settings below (along with the 30 minute resolution above)
// give you 24 half-hourly slots starting at 07:00, with the last slot
// being 18:30 -> 19:00

// The beginning of the first slot of the day (DEFAULT VALUES FOR NEW AREAS)
$morningstarts         = 7;   // must be integer in range 0-23
$morningstarts_minutes = 0;   // must be integer in range 0-59

// The beginning of the last slot of the day (DEFAULT VALUES FOR NEW AREAS)
$eveningends           = 21;  // must be integer in range 0-23
$eveningends_minutes   = 0;   // must be integer in range 0-59

// GENERAL SETTINGS
// ----------------

// This is the maximum number of rows (timeslots or periods) that one can
// expect to see in the day and week views.    It is used by mrbs.css.php for
// creating classes.    It does not matter if it is too large, except for the
// fact that more CSS than necessary will be generated.  (The variable is ignored
// if $times_along_top is set to true).

$max_slots = 60;

//Logo de la Facultad
$mrbs_company_logo = "logo_fca.png";

//Dias que se ocultan del calendario por ser no laborables

//Determina que el formato en el que se muestran los edificios ser√° un select (el otro valor posible es 'list')
